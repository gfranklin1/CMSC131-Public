### Project 1: Java Basics and Conditionals
Grade: 100/100

Developed Java programs for multiple tasks such as calculating the area of a triangle from base and height values entered by the user, dynamically generating hexadecimal color codes based on preferences, and creating a divisibility checker using condiitonal statements and arithmetic operations.

### Project 2: Java Loops
Grade: 100/100

Developed multiple Java programs including an access control system utilizing user input, a decimal to octal converter, and a die-throw simulation showcasing random number generation and interactive user interface design.

### Project 3: Drawing App
Grade: 97/100 (passed 13/16 secret tests)

Developed a Java program to create and manipulate a colored board representation using enumerated types, further demonstrating proficiency in Java, object-oriented programming, and algorithmic logic.

### Project 4: Passport
Grade: 98/100 (passed 6/8 secret tests)

Built a passport creation app in Java using Eclipse IDE that represents a personâ€™s passport.

### Project 5: Array Utilities
Grade: 99.5/100 (0.5/1 for style - code duplication)

Developed a Java utility class for array manipulation by implementing functionalities such as filtering elements within specified limits, string representation with custom separators, countign instances within a range, and array rotation.

### Project 6: Photo Manager
Grade: 99/100 (passed 9/10 secret tests)

Developed a photo manager application in Java which utilizes object-oriented programming principles, exception handing, and Arraylists to manage a collection of photos, thus allowing users to add, remove, and comment on photos.

### Project 7: Diagram System
Grade: 92/100 (passed 77/82 release tests, 9/12 secret tests)

Utilized a previous project, Drawing App, in order to create a versatile Java application that utilized random color generation and geometric shapes.

### Project 8: Media Manager
Grade: 93/100 (passed 3/10 release tests)

Developed a media rental management system in Java, incorporating features for managing movies and music albums. Implemented classes that allowed functionality for adding media, adding customers, renting, returning, and queue management. 

Utilized ArrayLists for storing media and customer information, and implemented methods for processing customer requests, including handling limited and unlimited rental plans. 

### Project 9: Recursion Exercise
Grade: 100/100

Implemented methods for adding delimiters, extracting digits, replacing characters, calculating the sum of even elements, obtaining row indices with a specified length, and recursively replacing cells in a 2D array.
